# Creating a table with a JSON column

Now that you know the basics about PostgreSQL and JSON, we can start with creating the database. For this Katacoda, we're using a single
table. Our *users* table from the first two steps is now extended with a column *grades* and is therefore renamed to *students*.

To create the table, run the following command:

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE students
(

)
```{{execute}}
