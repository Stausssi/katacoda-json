# Thank you for participating in this Katacoda!

You've learned the basic structure of a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL. The quick introduction to JSON
taught you how to create a JSON representation of any structure of your liking. Remember: **Anything** can be created by
only combining lists and collections. If you want your JSON data to follow a specific schema, check out *Further
Learning* for more information.

After covering the basics of relational databases and JSON, we've created a table containing a JSON column with a simple
SQL statement. Inserting JSON into your database is as easy as inserting a String, Integer, or whatever datatype you
desire. To parse the JSON directly in your SQL query, remember the operators `->` and `#>` to retrieve JSON objects,
and `-->` and `#>>` to convert the result into text.

I've attached two more links containing even more material about JSON in PostgreSQL databases for further learning.

## Further Learning

Another good tutorial concerning JSON in PostgreSQL can be
followed [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-json/).

The official PostgreSQL JSON documentation can be
found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html). It contains many more functions you can use
in your database.

If you want to learn how to define a structure for your JSON data, read [here](https://json-schema.org/).
